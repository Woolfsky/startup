### Elevator pitch
Accomplishing all of your tasks this week starts with effective organization, and I don't mean just listing all your to-do's in a note on your phone and hoping to finish them all. *Focus* is an app that not only helps you plan out your work but also helps you break down tasks into manageable elements and then prioritize and weight each of them. *Focus* even goes a step further by integrating the *Pomodoro Method* of using short, undistracted working sessions to power through your tasks. *Focus* is ideal for people who get distracted easily while working, who have a hard time breaking down and spacing out big tasks, or who simply want to accelerate their productivity.

### Technologies
I will use the required technologies in the following way:<br>
+ **HTML** - structure the pages and provide a menu to navigate throughout the app, also create buttons
+ **CSS** - make it look as aesthetically perfect as a blueberry muffin:)
+ **JavaScript** - add functionality to the buttons, 
+ **Service**
+ **DB**
+ **Login**
+ **Websocket**
