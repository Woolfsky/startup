        <h3>General Study Tips</h3>
        <p>
            Everyone learns differently, so there is no one-size-fits-all approach to studying. 
            However, there are some general tips that can help you study more effectively.
        </p>
        <p>
            Two tips that are often very effective include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <p><strong>Teach the material.</strong> Teaching the material to someone else or even to yourself out loud forces your mind to 
                re-organize the information in a way that makes sense to you. Try teaching each main chapter or idea to your 
                roommate or to your pillow, or stand up and walk around like you're teaching a class.</p>
            <p><strong>Quiz yourself.</strong> The most effective way to quiz yourself is to write out a practice test of your own creation. 
                As you study each section of the book, write 2-5 multiple choice or fill in the blank questions. 
                Try to make them as realistic as possible. Then, take the test in your next study session or the next day.</p>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Other general study tips include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <p><strong>Find a study space that works for you.</strong> Some people prefer to study in a quiet library, while others prefer to study at home or in a coffee shop. Experiment to find a space where you can focus and avoid distractions.</p>
            <p><strong>Set realistic goals.</strong> Don't try to cram all of your studying into one night. Instead, break down your studying into smaller, more manageable chunks.</p>
            <p><strong>Take breaks.</strong> It's important to take breaks while you're studying to avoid burnout. Get up and move around every 20-30 minutes, or take a longer break for lunch or dinner.</p>
            <p><strong>Reward yourself.</strong> When you reach a study goal, reward yourself with something you enjoy. This will help you stay motivated.</p>
        </ul>

            <p>I usually study best when I turn my phone completely off. Otherwise I get distracted super easily.</p>

            <p>I really have a hard time studying in my apartment. My roomates are coming in and out all day. I have to work in the library or in a coffee shop in the corner</p>
